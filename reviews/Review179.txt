General:
=======
Interesting paper with good results. The paper will benefit
from a bit better explanation in places, systematic
notation and a few more intermediate steps. It would also
be good to explain why such high sampling rate is needed
for the outer loop wrt to its BW and what are the relations
to the inner BW as well as coupling with the inner loop,
which is there in reality.
Please be systematic with vector/matrix bracket notation.
Both () and [] are used for the same. [] is recommended,
but please noel one.
In 3.3 it appear that all content is just repeat from the
Galzi paper; is that correct ?

======
p2column1
�Some interesting control�.�, 
would be good to say something about what is interesting,
else better to leave it out.

1st sentence of 2.1 belongs better in the introduction

Please say where the follower need to keep pos. const. for
energy savings.

p2c2
Fig 2.
Indicate what is north and east in the �e� frame.

Caption to be expanded to explain. Say what is \Delta p_c

Will be useful to also indicate p_i and p_{i-1} as used
later and would specify the 2 center of mass positions

p2c2 above (1)
Inertial frame is undefined. Please define clearly all
frames used.

�tracked by fast inner��
please explain what tracking means in this context; what is
controller wrt what by the inner loops

Eq. (7)
Please do not reuse variables adding new things to them as
in last term. Use a new one so the reader has a clear
definition of a variable through the paper.

p3c1
\Delta p(t) does not seem to be the relative position error
between i and i-1. Only if \Delta p_c = 0. Please make text
clearer.

What are the stability margins for the inner loops desired
?
Outer loop is not linear so asymptotic is used, but it
gives no margins. Can a metric for the margin be provided ?
What is the BW relationship between inner/outer loops ?

2.3
Max thrust�. but should control surfaces not be addressed
as they are more the actuators than thrust or ?

p3c1
sec. 3
wind frame is undefined !!!
Make definition and illustration of \Delta p�

p3c2
(27) also here variables are recycled and not contain more
than earlier. Recommended to avoid and define new variable

p4c1
Please define/explain what is �matching condition�.

3.3
Why can the inner loop controller not track��. Please
explain why.

Please explain better the relative degree r=[1,1,1]^T. It
is not clear to the reader.

(34) please use same font for all the �p� indices

(37-38) are not so very clear. Please provide a bit more
explanation.

What is the justification to use a simple Euler
discretisation rather than a proper Z-transform, the latter
being 100% correct at the sampling points ?

p4c2
Can you not obtain a sliding that is correct at the samples
by means of a Z-transform ?

\Phi�(k) below (45) not so clear as \Phi�(k) = \Phi�(k-1)
means it is constant ?

Please explain how you get (47).

p5c1
(49-52) need better explanation as it is not really clear
what is done here.

Any problems with local minima in (53). Please address the
issue.

What is the justification to use a simple and not very
accurate forward Euler for simulation, when the default
solver in Matlab is using a Kutta Merson or similar with
better precision ?

Can you say something about sensitivity to sensor noise ?

p5c2
Not clear how \Delta x�, \Delta x�, y�, z� all can be wing
tip to wing tip. Please elaborate a bit.

p6c1
What is the frequency of the �BW� since you need to sample
at 1kHz ?

The latter sampling frequency => The latter sampling time

p6c2
Please try to avoid any line markers like o, * etc, as it
clutter the view completely. Recommend to use well
contrasted different colors.
