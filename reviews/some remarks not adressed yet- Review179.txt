General:
=======
Interesting paper with good results. The paper will benefit
from a bit better explanation in places, systematic
notation and a few more intermediate steps. It would also
be good to explain why such high sampling rate is needed
for the outer loop wrt to its BW and what are the relations
to the inner BW as well as coupling with the inner loop,
which is there in reality.
Please be systematic with vector/matrix bracket notation.
Both () and [] are used for the same. [] is recommended,
but please noel one.

In 3.3 it appear that all content is just repeat from the
Galzi paper; is that correct ?
- yes

Details:
======
p2column1
�Some interesting control�.�, 
would be good to say something about what is interesting,
else better to leave it out.
- removed

1st sentence of 2.1 belongs better in the introduction
- moved sentence to Section 3 as problem statement.

Please say where the follower need to keep pos. const. for
energy savings.
- See after equ. 16,17: in the predecessor's wind frame

p2c2
Fig 2.
Indicate what is north and east in the �e� frame.
-> Done, added explanation (Jan).

Caption to be expanded to explain. Say what is \Delta p_c
- defined later, eq. 26

Will be useful to also indicate p_i and p_{i-1} as used
later and would specify the 2 center of mass positions
- I think it's pretty clear that p = (x y z)

p2c2 above (1)
Inertial frame is undefined. Please define clearly all
frames used.
- replaced by "NED frame"

�tracked by fast inner��
please explain what tracking means in this context; what is
controller wrt what by the inner loops
- added that inner loop dynamics not taken into account.

Eq. (7)
Please do not reuse variables adding new things to them as
in last term. Use a new one so the reader has a clear
definition of a variable through the paper.
- good point, !!!To be adressed!!!

p3c1
\Delta p(t) does not seem to be the relative position error
between i and i-1. Only if \Delta p_c = 0. Please make text
clearer.
- ??? \Delta p(t) is the relative position error, i.e. the difference between the
commanded and the actual relative position.

What are the stability margins for the inner loops desired
?
Outer loop is not linear so asymptotic is used, but it
gives no margins. Can a metric for the margin be provided ?
What is the BW relationship between inner/outer loops ?
- made explicit that inner loop dynamics are not considered

2.3
Max thrust�. but should control surfaces not be addressed
as they are more the actuators than thrust or ?
- It can safely be assumed that the control surfaces and maximum deflections
are sufficently large to reach the performance limits, i.e. stall.

p3c1
sec. 3
wind frame is undefined !!!
- standard frame in aeronautics

Make definition and illustration of \Delta p�
\Delta p is illustrated in Fig. 2

p3c2
(27) also here variables are recycled and not contain more
than earlier. Recommended to avoid and define new variable
- no, \Phi_u has not been used before, implicitly defined in eqs. 24, 25

p4c1
Please define/explain what is �matching condition�.
- standard term in sliding mode control, not on 6 pages.

3.3
Why can the inner loop controller not track��. Please
explain why.
- really?

Please explain better the relative degree r=[1,1,1]^T. It
is not clear to the reader.
- stanndard term in SMC

(34) please use same font for all the �p� indices
- all in italics now

(37-38) are not so very clear. Please provide a bit more
explanation.
- cant't be clear, just very short summary of CSMC, details are in Galzi paper

What is the justification to use a simple Euler
discretisation rather than a proper Z-transform, the latter
being 100% correct at the sampling points ?
- z transfrom = discrete-time equivalent of Laplace transformation -> ???
- we should look into the discretization method though

p4c2
Can you not obtain a sliding that is correct at the samples
by means of a Z-transform ?
- Does not remove issue of inter-sample overshoot in TSCSMC

\Phi�(k) below (45) not so clear as \Phi�(k) = \Phi�(k-1)
means it is constant ?
- assuming \Phi(k) = \Phi(k-1) for disturbance estimation - sounds clear to me.
- done: forgot some subscrips (Phi -> Phi_u)

Please explain how you get (47).
- no space

p5c1
(49-52) need better explanation as it is not really clear
what is done here.
- no space

Any problems with local minima in (53). Please address the
issue.
- good point, but no space and not investigated yet

What is the justification to use a simple and not very
accurate forward Euler for simulation, when the default
solver in Matlab is using a Kutta Merson or similar with
better precision ?
- simulating the system with standard Simulink solver drastically changes the results, more chattering
 in the DSMC and PDSMC
- !!! needs to be investigated further

Can you say something about sensitivity to sensor noise ?
- Added in conclusion that sensor noise will be considered in future work

p5c2
Not clear how \Delta x�, \Delta x�, y�, z� all can be wing
tip to wing tip. Please elaborate a bit.
- it's a vector

p6c1
What is the frequency of the �BW� since you need to sample
at 1kHz ?
- ???

The latter sampling frequency => The latter sampling time
- corrected

p6c2
Please try to avoid any line markers like o, * etc, as it
clutter the view completely. Recommend to use well
contrasted different colors.
- this is by design to enable black&white printing
